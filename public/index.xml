      <description>In the last post, I talked about an issue for specifiabilty and quantification. In this post, I want to talk a little more in detail about a more general form of Geach substitutional quantification.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about different ways to talk about quantification.
Specifically, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about two different semantic interpretations of the quantifiers. On the objectual interpretation of the quantifiers, \( \forall x \phi(x) \) is true if for every object \(d\) in the domain, \(\phi[d/x]\) is true. This is usually spelled out in terms of variable assignments to distinguish it more sharply from the other interpretation. On the substitutional interpretation of the quantifiers \( \Pi x \phi(x) \) is true if for every closed term \(t\) of the language, \(\phi[t/x]\) is true.</description>

      <description>My idea for this blog is to collect and catalog things that bring me joy. Why am I doing this? Well, my life feels lacking in joy due to some Big Depressed Moods that have been haunting my life the past few weeks. So this is a willful effort to (1) notice the joyous things that I would otherwise dismiss and (2) seek out more things that might bring me joy.</description>

      <description>This is a blog about mathematics (especially logic, category theory, and algebra), philosophy (especially epistemology, philosophy of science, and metaphysics), and other things that make me happy, like poetry.</description>

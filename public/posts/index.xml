      <description>My idea for this blog is to collect and catalog things that bring me joy. Why am I doing this? Well, my life feels lacking in joy due to some Big Depressed Moods that have been haunting my life the past few weeks. So this is a willful effort to (1) notice the joyous things that I would otherwise dismiss and (2) seek out more things that might bring me joy.</description>

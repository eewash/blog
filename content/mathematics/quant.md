I've been thinking about different ways to talk about quantification. Or rather, I've been thinking about two different semantic interpretations of the quantifiers. On the *objectual* interpretation of the quantifiers, $$ \forall x \phi(x) $$ is true if for every object $$d$$ in the domain, $$\phi[d/x]$$ is true. This is usually spelled out in terms of variable assignment to distinguish it more sharply from the other interpretation. On the *substitutional* interpretation of the quantifiers $$ \forall x \phi(x) $$ is true if for every closed term $$t$$, $$\phi[t/x] $$ is true. 

Substitutional quantification is language-relative. The truth of a given quantified sentence depends on what closed terms are available in the language. One might think this runs into particular problems when we want to talk about the truth of quantified sentences in uncountable structures, like say, the reals.
